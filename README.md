BlockEdfHeatMapView
===================


A heatmap can be created for each signal in an EDF or for selected signals. Alternatively, a panel of heatmaps can be created. Heatmap's x axis can be selected from preset durations that correspond to values often used in sleep and circadian research. The HeatMap function is designed to provide a way to quickly review the contents of large number of sleep studies.


## Getting started:
The fastest way to get started is to run tests in the associated test file. Public properties contain the most common parameters for configuring HeatMaps.  More advance users may want to review private properties before modifying.

### Examples included in test file
* TEST_1: Specify edf as a file
* TEST_2: Specify signals to heatmaps to generate
* TEST_3: Specify EDF data as a structure
* TEST_4: Change default figure options to a 5 minute window
* TEST_5  Test heatmap resolution (2, 32, and 128)
* TEST_6  Create panel
* TEST_7  Summarize folder of EDFs by creating a pandel for each EDF and saving the figures in a power point file.
